Hello and welcome to my personal website!

I'm Turab Hasanli, a computer science student and passionate game developer. I'm thrilled to have you here and excited to share my journey with you through this blog.

## What You'll Find Here

This site is my digital home where I'll be sharing:

- **Game Development Projects** - From small prototypes to published games on itch.io
- **Programming Adventures** - Learning experiences with Unity, C#, and other technologies  
- **Creative Process** - Behind-the-scenes looks at how I approach game design and problem-solving
- **Teaching Moments** - Insights from running my school's game development club

## My Journey So Far

I've always been fascinated by the magic of interactive experiences. What started as curiosity about how games work has evolved into a passion for creating them. Currently, I'm studying computer science while actively developing games and teaching others through my school's game development club.

## What's Coming Next

I'm working on several exciting projects that I can't wait to share with you. From experimental game mechanics to collaborative projects with my club members, there's always something new in development.

Thank you for visiting, and I hope you'll join me on this creative journey. Feel free to explore my projects, check out my games on itch.io, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or just want to chat about game development!

Happy gaming! 🎮
